<h1 style="text-align: center;">Intro</h1>

Hi, I am a young robotic engineer enthusiast to discover and learn new things. I am currently doing a mandatory Swiss civil service and using this opportunity to experiment coding all kinds of things, including this website. Throughout my studies, I was always motivated to tackle new challenges and accomplish various projects. I had the opportunity to do very low-level programming using logical gates to create a game embedded in an alarm clock or assembly to navigate an e-puck robot. However, I also had the possibility to work with more advanced robots, on wheels or quadcopter, using Python. In addition to those hardware projects, I had the possibility to experiment with various robot simulation or deep learning tasks.

Before all those robotic-related projects, I achieved a micro-engineering bachelor during which I had all kinds of experiences around more mechanical engineering, working with optics, soft-muscles, and a fair bit of control classes, from simple PID up to MPC and Adaptive control design. Overall, this general view of engineering always motivated me as it gives a big picture of all aspects of technology, from materials science up to state-of-the-art deep learning. All of those projects can be explored in a bit more detail in the Projects section if you are interested.

In addition to learning new things, I am very invested in pushing myself in bouldering and lead climbing. Discovering this sport during my study was a revelation as it requires being very aware of my body and total control of it. In addition, being in the middle of the mountains or forests allows me to clear my mind and be more focused.

Furthermore, I am very interested in art in general. From the history of art up to the very contemporary art scene, I am always eager to discover what is happening! If you want to meet me, you can be sure to find me at the Venice Art Biennale or in a museum in every city I visit. Luckily, I had the opportunity to visit a lot of them as I traveled all around the world almost since my first travel to India in 1999. Ever since, I am always more than enthusiastic to go on an adventure, leading me to visit 37 countries! My passion for Asia, due to its amazing food and landscapes, made me go to China and India multiple times always wanting to go back!

<h1 style="text-align: center;">What is next?</h1>

While I am completing my civil duty in Switzerland, I have time to wander around the coding world, trying out multiple things! However, I will also have the ability to work at CHUV to tackle the question of medical image deep learning for 3D invariant segmentation! As it may be understood looking at my project and interests, I cannot focus on only one project as I want to be a part of every aspect of technology and help create tools to help others!
